# MIDAS Tasks

- Speech_Emotion_Recognition folder contains a .ipynb notebook and a requirement_library.txt file. Fork and clone the repo. Use the terminal and change the directory to Speech_Emotion_Recognition folder. To install all the libraries required to run the notebook successfully, use the command <b> pip install -r requirement_library.txt </b>
  
- Understanding-The-Planet folder contains a .ipynb notebook and a requirements_amazon.txt file. Fork and clone the repo. Use the terminal and change the directory to Understanding-The-Planet folder. To install all the libraries required to run the notebook successfully, use the command <b> pip install -r requirements_amazon.txt </b> 
  
- Both the .ipynb notebooks where coded on google colab. It would be an easier option to just download and open the notebook on colab (which is prepackaged with all the used libraries)
